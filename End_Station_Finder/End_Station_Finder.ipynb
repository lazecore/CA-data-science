    "My friend Lou has a project. They want to visit all the end stations on the Berlin S-Bahn and U-Bahn system. However, to count as a truly satisfying end station, the station must not only be at the end of its own line, but must also lack an interchange to another line. Lou wants only the end-iest of end stations."
